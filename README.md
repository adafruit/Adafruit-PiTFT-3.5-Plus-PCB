This display for the Raspberry Pi features a 3.5" display with 480x320 16-bit color pixels and a resistive touch overlay just like our popular original, but this one is engineered specifically to work with the newer "2x20 connector" Raspberry Pi's. The plate uses the high speed SPI interface on the Pi and can use the mini display as a console, X window port, displaying images or video etc. Best of all it plugs right in on top!

This PiTFT 3.5" is designed to fit nicely onto the Raspberry Pi Zero, Pi 3, Pi 2 or Model A+ / B+ (any Pi with a 2x20 connector). Not for use with an old Pi 1 with 2x13 connector If you'd like to use a 3.5" display with the original Pi A or Pi B, check out this version
